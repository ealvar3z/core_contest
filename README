NAME

hallucination-nonidentifiability — structural impossibility result for next-token models

SYNOPSIS

A proof that hallucination is unavoidable in next-token language models under
text-only learning, underspecified prompts, and forced emission.

DESCRIPTION

This repository contains a self-contained structural argument showing that,
when the underlying world state is non-identifiable from text and the system
must act, false factual assertions are unavoidable.

The result is independent of scale, optimization quality, or architecture.
